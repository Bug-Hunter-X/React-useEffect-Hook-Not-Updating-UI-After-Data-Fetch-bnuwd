# React useEffect Hook Not Updating UI After Data Fetch

This repository demonstrates a common issue in React applications where the `useEffect` hook fails to update the UI after fetching data from an API.  The data is fetched correctly, but the component does not re-render with the new data.  This is often due to incorrect dependency management or missing key logic.

## Bug Description
The provided `MyComponent` fetches data from an API using `fetch`. The data is successfully received, however the UI remains unchanged displaying the initial loading state.  Debugging reveals that the state is correctly updated, but a re-render is not triggered.

## Solution
The solution involves ensuring that the `useEffect` hook correctly updates the UI by including appropriate dependencies.  If the data being fetched is causing the problem, the component must be dependent on the data to cause a re-render when it changes. This repo demonstrates both the incorrect and correct approaches.

## How to Reproduce
1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Start the development server (e.g., `npm start`).
4. Observe the initial loading state and that the data doesn't appear even if fetched successfully.

This example uses a mock API, but the principles apply to real-world API calls as well.
